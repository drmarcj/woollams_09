Code for running and testing the simulator

pt_train: trains the network. Current binary is for MacOS Intel, but it 
should compile for any other kind of system. Try to use BLAS and Altivec 
extensions if at all possible.

To train the model you do something like this:
pt_train -rpat repeating.pat -gpat gen.pat -spat speaking.pat  -hpat 
hearing.pat

nb the published version of this model was trained to 3.5M iterations, and 
was tested using those final weights. I ran 10 sims with different seeds 
(if you need to do this, please note currently seed is hard coded!) That 
created 10  individual 'subjects'

eval_hearing, eval_speaking: tests the network. This also requires...
mapping, sem_mapping: vectors for the phonology or semantics, so we can 
compare outputs to what is 'correct'

Please see analyzeit.sh in ../utilities for an example of how I run these
